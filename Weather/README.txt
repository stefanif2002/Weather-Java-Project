For this project to run smoothly you need to have downloaded both jdk and netbeans (it can run only with jdk but its difficult) 
After th downloads open jdk import the DOWNLOADED project and run it.
In the file path you can insert what ever .csv file you want but the file must have the same layout as the CsV and CsV1 files that I provide consider using them to prevent problems
For any complications you are free to make adjustments or contact me: Ifoulis.Stefanos@gmail.com
